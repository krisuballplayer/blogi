# Project Title

Blogi

## Description

It's a practical work for my Web Programming Course. It's a simple blog. The main purpose during the development of the blog, was to learn how to use ReactJS and especially Routing. It is not supposed to work as a real blog or to be used as one, but it clearly thaught me how to use routing and props-drilling. Thank You!! To all the You Tube-channels, which helped me to build this!!
